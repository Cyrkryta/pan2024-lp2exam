1,"And more importantly, the 'militia' being referred to isn't really a thing in the US anymore the way the 2nd Amendment is talking about: the modern equivalent of the 'militia' being referred to would be state National Guard units and state defense force units (in fact, some of the original militia units are now National Guard units) but even then the original version was compulsory service that involved essentially every ""free able-bodied white male"" between ages 18 and 45 (in organizations with officers appointed by their state and run by the state based on the rules set by the Federal government) and the US doesn't have compulsory service.","No. In a time of no standing military, militias were necessary for national defense. And 2A was added to prevent the federal government from leaving a state defenseless. You're reading into 2A words that aren't there. You are, in effect, arguing that arms must be allowed in order to overthrow the government, to stage a insurrection. Yet the provisions I cited above explicitly say one of the purposes of militias is to put down insurrections and to enforce the law. So, which is true? The one people claim is the implied justification of the 2A, or the one the Constitution explicitly says is the justification in Art. I? If the Framers intended for your interpretation, they knew how to be explicit, as they were in drafting Art. I, § 8, cl. 15-16. The specific overrides the general, and the explicit overrides the implicit. It cannot be true that Congress can provide for militias to be used to enforce the law and put down insurrections, and can provide for organizing, disciplining, and training them to these ends, but also that militias exist to be able to engage in insurrection, violating the law by use of force,and that Congress has no power to regulate or mandate training.

Profit-driven enterprises will skimp on such a wasteful allocation of resources and then make outsize profits when floating prices result in huge swings during high demand periods. Other companies have to purchase on the open market but charge a fixed-ish rate to consumers, so they're incentivized to turn off power during these periods and the consumers are not incentivized to ration usage. Other companies pass through market costs to consumers, and they rack up astronomical bills before they realize anything has happened. In effect many actors in the system are being rewarded for not providing a reliable service. In theory, all the actors would have perfect information and pay more to have more reliable energy and ration as perfectly-floating prices moved up. But theory is no way to run an energy grid. State lawmakers and regulators are too blinded by dogma and too ignorant of what markets are capable of in practice to create a system that works for people rather than corporations. Just guessing, but ample campaign contributions may also play a part.","Texas is already polluted beyond uninhabitability.

Let me just begin by thanking my good friend, pete aguilar, for his very generous words of introduction and for placing my name into nomination, a total of nine times. And I also want to thank my other colleagues from the democratic caucus for your generous words of nomination, as well as jim clyburn, katherine clark, ted lewan veronica escobar. And I thank my colleagues and my friends in the house democratic caucus for your perseverance, four your strenh, for your friendship and for your purpose and for your unanimous support. And I simply want to say that showing of strenh is not for any one particular individual. It will be a showing of strenh throughout the 118th congress, you nammity of purpose on behalf of the american people. Before I proceed any further, let me begin by acknowledging the distinguished gentlelady from the great state of california, the iconic, the heroic, legendary nancy pelosi. . . . . And without question in my mind, speaker emerita pelosi will go down in history as the greatest speaker of all time. Throughout her time -- throughout her time in congress, she's been a legendary legislator, a fabulous facilitator, and a no-nonsense negotiator. We know that nancy pelosi is a woman of faith, a loving wife, a mother of five, a grandmother of nine. A defenders of democracy. A voice for the voiceless. And a powerful champion for the children, the climate, charm city, california, the caucus, the congress, the country, and the constitution. Thank you, madam speaker, for all that you have done, it's an honor to stand on your broad shoulders. As well -- as well as the shoulders of the great steny hoyer and the great jim clyburn, two consequential leaders in their own right. Scripture says in galatians, let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Over the last two years, house democrats in partnership with president biden and our colleagues in the senate have been hard at work on behalf of the american people, getting big things done. We passed the american rescue plan. Saved the economy from a deep recession. Put shots in arm, money in pockets and kids back in school. We passed the infrastructure investment and jobs act. To create millions of good-paying jobs. Fix our crumbling bridges, roads, tunnels, our airports, our sewer and water system, mass transportation systems and ensure high speed internet access in every single community community. We passed gun safety legislation for the first time in 30 years that will save lives and make our communities safer. We passed the chips in science act to bring domestic manufacturing jobs back home to the united states of america and ensure that our work force has the skills to succeed in the 21st century economy and we passed the inflation reduction act to strike a dramatic blow against the climate crisis, set our planet on a sustainable trajectory forward, lower energy costs, strenhen the affordable care act, lower health care costs and drive down the high price of life-saving prescription drugs for millions of americans. It was one of the most consequential congresses in american history. President biden gets the job done and the d in democrat stands for deliver. So over the next two years, over the next -- over the next two years -- as we begin this 118th congress, let us continue to fight for lower costs. Let us continue to fight in this congress for better paying jobs. Let us continue to fight in this congress for safer communities. Let us continue to fight in this congress to defend democracy. Let us continue to fight in this congress to put and protect the public interests. Let us continue to fight in this congress for economic opportunity in every single zip code and let us continue to fight in this congress for reproductive freedom. Because -- because as democrats we do believe in a country for everyone. We do believe in a country for everyone. A country that provides for the poor. Works for working families. Makes sense for the middle class. Stands up for senior citizens. Innovates in the inner city. Strenhens suburban communities, helps out the heartland and revitalizes rural america. We believe in a country with liberty and justice for all. Equal protection under the law. Free and fair elections and yes, we believe in a country with the peaceful transfer of power. We believe -- that in america our diversity is a strenh. It is not a weakness. An economic strenh, a competitive strenh, a cultural strenh. Our diversity is a strenh. It is not a weakness. We are a gorgeous mosaic of people from throughout the world. As john lewis would sometimes remind us on this floor, we may have come over on different ships but we're all in the same boat now. We are white, we are black,erer latino, we are asian, we are native american, we are christian, we are jewish, we are muslim, we are hindu, we are religious, we are secular, we are gay, we are straight, we are young, we are older, we are women, we are men, we are citizens, we are dreamers, out of many we are one. That's what makes america a great country. And no matter what kind of haters are trying to divide us, we're not going to let anyone take that away from us, not now, not ever. This is the united states of america. A land of opportunity. The fact that I'm able to stand up here today is another data point in that narrative. I was born in brooklyn hospital, raised in a working class neighborhood in crown heights, grew up in the cornerstone baptist church. Started off in the cradle roll department, somehow survived the violence of the crack cocaine epidemic and wound up here in the united states congress as the highest ranking democrat in the house of representatives. America truly a land of opportunity. Government of the people, by the people, and for the people. So on this first day, let us commit to the american dream. A dream that promises that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should be table provide a comfortable living for yourself and for your family. Educate your children. Purchase a home. And one day retire with grace and dignity. Let us commit on this first day to lift up the american dream for every single person in this nation. Now I recognize that this is a moment of transition. As we transition from one congress to the next, from one majority to the next. From a year of accomplishment, a year of accomplishment to a year of ambiguity. A moment of transition. The american people understandably after the events of this week recognize that the congress is at a fork in the road. And are asking the question, what direction will we choose? On this first day, I do not pretend to answer that question on behalf of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But we do extend our hand of partnership to you. And want to make clear that we extend and intend to try to find common ground, whenever and wherever possible on behalf of the american people. Not as democrats, not as republicans, not as independents, but as americans. But I also want to make clear that we will never compromise our principles. House democrats will always put american values over autocracy. Benevolence over bigotry. The constitution over the code. Democracy over demagogues. Economic opportunity over extremism. Freedom over fascism. Governing over gaslighting. Hopefulness over hatred. Inclusion over isolation. Justice over judicial overreach. Knowledge over kangaroo courts. Liberty over limitation. Maturity over mar-a-lago. Normalcy over negativity. Opportunity over obstruction. People over politics. Quality of life issues over q-anon. Reason over racism. Substance over slander. Triumph over tyranny. Understanding over ugliness. Voting rights over voter suppression. Working families over the well-connected. Xennial over xenophobia. Yes we can over you can do it. And -- we will always do the right thing by the american people. So let us not grow weary of doing good. For the american people will reap the benefit of the harvest if we do not give up.

And god bless the united states of.","Jeffries is a supporter of M4A which the progressives never ""force the vote"" on because it would get crushed and set them back a decade, but sure the progressive caucus guy who got every vote from the squad only got it because there's obviously a difference between debating policy and the speaker vote.",1.0

It’s why the Tabor Amendment to the state constitution exists, which was approved by voters in 1992, limits the amount of revenue the State of Colorado can retain and spend. Specifically, TABOR allows the state to retain and spend an amount based on the prior fiscal year's actual revenue or limit, whichever was lower, grown by Colorado inflation and population growth and adjusted for any ""voter-approved revenue changes."" As in, the Governor can’t just change tax laws without voter approval.",1.0

Because starting a nuclear weapons program costs multiple points of your GDP in investment alone and once you have tried to acquire raw fissile material, almost every single major political and financial power will sanction your economy into dust. Iran has once again started their nuclear program and they are the second most sanctioned country in the world, only because the terrorist state of Russia overtook them for obvious reasons. Once the US and Israel actually get seriously worried about them making a functional warhead they’ll get sanctioned back into the times of great Persia. If the current Iranian regime is still in power by that point anyway and it’s entirely possible that after said sanctions another revolution could occur.","Hahaha! Credibility?

484,"Just to share my experience (though note, I don't live in New York) - I have someone in my family with Bipolar, primarily they suffer from psychosis manic-type when they cycle. She refuses to take medicine. The part of her brain that determines reality is completely broken when she's manic. In our area, we have like the 'regular' police, but when you call to get her evaluated to be committed (when you can tell she's about to 'pop'), you have to request a 'crisis' officer. These officers are trained to recognize mental illness, and how they need to handle those suffering from it, how to de-escalate, etc. I have only ever experienced (and heard, when unable to be present) great things from those officers - they have only ever helped and not made it worse. I was so grateful for their help. I live in a southern state, so knowing these officers were available was kind of surprising to be honest, but I was glad to know they are available. Maybe New York has crisis officers too, and if so, I could see how they could be called to assist in cases like this (I'm not sure if they do or not though). The thing is, the people who have to be involuntarily committed like this (like my family member), they are often repeats (in and out of hospitals because they refuse to stay medicated), and the officers come to know who those people are, what symptoms they exhibit that show they're spiraling, etc. If we had waited for the officers to commit my family member until after committing an 'act', that literally would have been good for nobody. Thankfully they're able to assess a person's judgement here (similar to how this directive sounds). There's more that can be done in these situations, but it usually involves the courts determining they can't take care of themselves, supported by medical documentation. Usually a family member or social worker would manage their affairs, and if they are found to be off medication, they can be readmitted involuntarily. Unfortunately, there is usually so much red tape between doctors and the courts, very few families find themselves able to get through the whole process to get their family member stable care through a conservatorship.","r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.

Fuel Load for a maximum trip (6,300 miles) is 33,000 gallons. Let’s consider a trip across the USA, California to New York (2,915 miles). The distance in question is 46% of the maximum range of the plane, so it would be loaded with only 50% of its fuel capacity (16,500 Gallons). Let’s assume it all gets burned (it doesn’t, but whatever). Now let’s take those same 300 folks and put them in 200 cars (1/3 of the total are driving together). Let’s assume they are driving average cars, pickups and SUVs instead of electric, hybrid, etc cars, so we are getting an average of about 20 MPG (probably less, but again, whatever). The distance of 2,915 miles at 20 MPG would result in a fuel burn of 146 Gallons of fuel per car. 146 Gallons x 200 Cars = 29,200 Gallons of fuel… nearly TWICE what that single passenger plane would consume, despite all the “whatever” guesses in the favor of the cars. 🤔 A “magnitude more” fuel would mean the plane would be burning 1,000% more than the cars.

1222,"I used 2012 as an example because of the way the House was split unevenly due to gerrymandering and how it showed how quickly Republican control of the majority of state legislatures, and therefore district mapping, had rigged the game against Democrats that enjoyed vastly wider popularity across the general electorate.","Personally, I feel this should be a prime example of why we should have representatives picked on a ratio basis of state votes as opposed to candidates running for individual districts, as most states have such lenient residency requirements for qualifying to run in a district as to make it laughable that a candidate needs to ""know"" their district. See Marjorie Taylor Greene or even Dr. Oz (yeah, I know, he didn't run in districted election, but he qualified to run without even actually having lived in the state for any appreciable amount of time, which was a factor in him losing) or any other carpetbagger that has won an election, quite honestly. Would I rather advocate for representatives to have at least a decent amount of experience within their own district? Absolutely. Am I being pragmatic about the way candidates move to qualify for a district they believe they can win as opposed to winning the district they're in and the way districts are redrawn every ten years, negating most or all of the ""hometown"" essence behind being a representative? I believe so. I used to live in a district that had a 200 by 20 mile with rural bubbles on the sides, splitting three heavily blue cities into multiple other districts that all went red because of how they were split up and countered by the rural vote. That's how you get cities that vote for blue presidents and blue senators and blue governors (and other blue statewide seats and mayor's/city leadership) but have solid red representatives in the US House and State legislatures. We had a cardboard cutout of our rep at town halls because he refused to show up to meet constituents unless it was a Republican donor event. There's a lot of that going on outside of major cities now, and even in some of the bigger cities. Just look at Nashville after this election. Gerrymandering split apart a very blue city with a large population to the point that there are no Democrats representing it, and only 1 Democrat was elected to the house from Tennessee, even though the numbers should have had 2 Democrats, at minimum. The Wisconsin elections are just as skewed, with districts radiating from Milwaukee and Madison in a way as to concentrate blue votes inside the cities and then negate them on the edges with sprawling districts that only make sense if you are admitting you can't win an election with maps that are remotely fair.",1.0
